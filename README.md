## Tools for Responsive UI
### MediaQuery 
Used to query the screenâ€™s size, orientation, and other properties. Essential for adapting layouts dynamically.
### Layout Builder
Ideal for customizing UI based on the constraints of the parent widget.especially useful for adapting to different device types like tablets, mobiles, and desktops.
### Expanded 
Allocates the remaining available space to a widget within a Row, Column. Helps distribute space efficiently.
### Flexible
Gives a widget its natural size but allows it to shrink if space is limited.
### FittedBox
FittedBox takes a child widget and resizes it to fit within the space given by its parent. It scales the child up or down and aligns it so that it doesnâ€™t overflow or get clipped.
### AspectRatio
Maintains a specific width-to-height ratio for its child. Useful for consistent sizing across devices.
### IntrinsicHeight / IntrinsicWidth
Measures the size of the largest child and adjusts the parentâ€™s height or width accordingly.

### MediaQuery vs LayoutBuilder
- MediaQuery returns the actual size of the entire screen.
- LayoutBuilder returns the size of its parent widgetâ€™s constraints.

## Responsive Text Sizing
To ensure font sizes adapt smoothly across devices, use the following approach:

### ðŸ”§ Key Concepts
- Base Font Size: The original font size used as a reference.
- Scale Factor: Adjusts font size based on device width.
    - Formula: `Scale Factor = currentWidth / widthPlatform` (where widthPlatform is the breakpoint width for Desktop, Tablet, or Mobile)
- Responsive Font Size: `Responsive Font Size = Base Font Size Ã— Scale Factor`
- Limits
    - Lower Limit: `Lower Limit = Base Font Size Ã— 0.8`
    - Upper Limit: `Upper Limit = Base Font Size Ã— 1.2`
- Clamp the responsive size between the limits: Final Font Size = clamp(Lower Limit, Responsive Font Size, Upper Limit)
